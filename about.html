                    <p>At ASCENDX, we are dedicated to empowering the people of today with the marvelous technologies of tomorrow.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It all began in 1961 when Dalton Hunter Jr., a courageous young man with nothing but a pocket full of dreams and a 1.5 million dollar loan from his father, founded Ascent Industries and made his mark as a humble, trusted and old-fashioned Government Experimental Weapons and Military Applications Research & Development Contractor.
                        <br><br>More than half a century later, thanks to the acquisition of Ascent Industries by our good friends at the Wánchéng Global Interest Group in 2029, we became ASCENDX and have expanded our business into the public sector, making our products available to civilians and empowering everyone in the world to reach new heights!</p>
