                        <p>ASCENDX FUTURE CORP is a diversified technologies company, founded in 1978 as Ascent Industries before its acquisition and rebranding by the Wánchéng Global Interest Group in 2023. ASCENDX is dedicated to empowering the ventures of today with the marvelous technologies of tomorrow.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <br><br>More than half a century later, thanks to the acquisition of Ascent Industries by our good friends at the Wánchéng Global Interest Group in 2029, we became ASCENDX and have expanded our business into the public sector, making our products available to civilians and empowering everyone in the world to reach new heights!</p>
